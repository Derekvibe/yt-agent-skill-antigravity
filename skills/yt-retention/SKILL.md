# yt-retention

The retention graph is the only honest feedback YouTube gives you. Almost nobody exports it.

Run these from this skill's own folder (the one containing this SKILL.md). If `python3` is not found (common on Windows), use `python`.

```bash
python3 retention.py retention.csv --duration 600
python3 retention.py retention.csv --transcript transcript.srt
```

Getting the file: Studio -> a video -> Analytics -> Engagement -> the audience-retention chart ->
the download icon -> "Audience retention".

## Three different problems

- **HOOK LEAK** - what is lost in the first 30 seconds. Under 25% is healthy. This is always the
  first thing to fix and it is always the first fifteen seconds of script, never the edit.
- **CLIFFS** - single steep drops. A cliff is a moment: a topic change with no signposting, a
  sponsor read, a long setup. With `--transcript` the tool prints what was being said there, which
  is what makes the report actionable instead of interesting.
- **SLIDE** - the steady bleed across the middle. A flat slide is pacing. The fix is cutting, not
  rewriting.

## What to hand back

Name the single biggest leak and one change for it. Not a list of five. Then, only if asked, the
rest. And if the hook leak is healthy and the slide is flat, say the video is fine and the problem
is packaging - send them to `/yt-package`.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**

## Save to the video pack

When the result is final, save it so the user gets one file per video instead of only a chat reply.
Show the result in chat as usual, then save the retention read: hook leak, cliffs and the changes to make. Save it as the `retention` section.

1. Use the video's name (reuse the name already used in this conversation, otherwise the working title). The pack lives in the `videos` folder at the root of the user's open workspace.
2. Write the section text to a temporary file with your file tool, then run this from this skill's
   folder (use `python` if `python3` is not found):

```bash
python3 ../yt-pack/pack.py add --root "<workspace>/videos" --video "<video name>" --section retention --file "<temp file>" --delete-source
```

3. End your reply with the file path the command prints. If the command refuses the folder, ask the
   user for their project folder. Never save inside the skills folder.
