description: >-
  Write and lint the title and thumbnail for a YouTube video as one pairing,
  checking truncation, duplication and vagueness before publish. Use for
  "title ideas", "what should I call this", "thumbnail text", "my CTR is
  bad", packaging, or any request to rename or repackage an existing video.

# yt-package

The title and the thumbnail are ONE unit. Writing them separately is why most packaging fails: the
thumbnail repeats the title, and half the click surface says the same thing twice.

Run these from this skill's own folder (the one containing this SKILL.md). If `python3` is not found (common on Windows), use `python`.

```bash
python3 title.py --title "..." --thumb "AI RAN IT"
python3 title.py titles.txt            # one per line, ranked
```

## Before you write

1. Read `.agents/youtube/voice.md` in the workspace, or `~/.gemini/config/youtube/voice.md` if that is where it lives, whichever exists. That is the user's voice profile: how they talk
   on camera, the words they never use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it
   does not exist, ask for **three of their own videos**, read or transcribe them, infer the voice,
   and write the file. A script in the wrong voice is worse than no script, because they have to
   read it out loud.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it. That includes prices, percentages, savings amounts, bank or product names and "studies show" claims. Exception: if voice.md says illustrative estimates are allowed, round example amounts are fine when labelled as examples or estimates ("say, around $200"), but never present a made-up figure as the creator's own result, a real statistic or a sourced fact.

## Rules the tool enforces, and why

- **60 characters** is where desktop search truncates, **40** is a mobile home feed. Both are
  reported because they fail differently: a desktop cut loses the tail, a mobile cut can lose the
  subject.
- **The thumbnail must not repeat the title.** Different words, same promise.
- **Three words maximum on the thumbnail.** At feed size a fourth word is a grey smear.
- **A number, a name or a date** beats every adjective available to you.
- **Two all-caps words is the ceiling** before a title reads as spam.

## Write ten, keep two

Generate ten titles, run them all through `title.py`, show the user the top three with their scores
and the specific issue on each. For the winner, write the thumbnail brief: the expression, the
framing, the three words, and what the background has to do to hold contrast at feed size.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. This skill writes and you publish. Every output ends in a block the user
copies, and the last line of every run is the question: **ship it, or change it?**

## Save to the video pack

When the result is final, save it so the user gets one file per video instead of only a chat reply.
Show the result in chat as usual, then save the chosen title and thumbnail pairing with the lint result. Save it as the `package` section.

1. Use the video's name (reuse the name already used in this conversation, otherwise the working title). The pack lives in the `videos` folder at the root of the user's open workspace.
2. Write the section text to a temporary file with your file tool, then run this from this skill's
   folder (use `python` if `python3` is not found):

```bash
python3 ../yt-pack/pack.py add --root "<workspace>/videos" --video "<video name>" --section package --file "<temp file>" --delete-source
```

3. End your reply with the file path the command prints. If the command refuses the folder, ask the
   user for their project folder. Never save inside the skills folder.
